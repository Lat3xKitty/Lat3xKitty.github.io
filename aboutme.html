            <h2>Getting into my Fetishes</h2>
            <p>
From a young age I had always enjoyed Rubber Gloves. I'd like to do a little bit of Washing up as a child and always loved putting on the Gloves to do washing... So much so that my parents would even hide them every so often.
Growing up, I always had a strange interest in Gloves I could never really understand. I got to my young Teenage years and would start to take some of the Gloves from the School Textiles class. At home, I'd just have these strange enjoyments with them and have wild dreams about them.
After a while I could have some money to buy my own gloves. Continued to get some nice Sterile Gloves. I didn't like the waste of each Glove after use, so I decided that I should look into getting some Reusable Latex (Fashion) Gloves.

After getting these pairs of Gloves, I really liked the slightly thicker & Stronger feeling of Latex. I decided to get myself some cheap Latex Stockings, as well as a small Latex accessories kit including a Tie on collar, Mitts/Finger less gloves and a hair clip.
This only continued as I bought myself some small Latex outfits... and more and more and more... You can see where this went.

            <h2>Start Sharing Photos</h2>
            <p>
In the UK when Covid hit, we had a Scheme called Furlough, which basically paid us a decent amount of our normal wage but had to do 0 work. I was in Furlough from April -> Mid October.
April -> May/June I had kinda given up with the normal random stuff I had done... and had shared a few pictures of my Clothes to some of the fetish communities I had joined on discord.

Eventually I decided that I could share some more with the world by putting them on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lat3xkitty/">Instagram</a> & <a href="https://twitter.com/Lat3xKitty">Twitter</a> and the compliments and likes would be something to help keep myself mentally positive during the crap times of Covid.
            </p>

            <h2>Face & Details</h2>
            <p>
As you may notice, I tend to not show my face. This is for Privacy Reasons.
I will likely never show a Full Clean picture of my Face... I however may show Filtered, Blurred or Half Face within my photos. Especially on a place like FetLife, things are a bit more open for people to be able to see what you share, and simply don't want people to recognise me for what I post & Simply being part of a Fetish at a young age.
