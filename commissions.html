            <h3>Current Situation</h3>
            <i>(Last updated 25th May 2022)</i>
            <p>
                Currently doing commissions on a case by case situation, and typically not accepting many of them to keep me focused on my work and normal content.
                Pop me a message answering the questions below and I will consider it, and get back to you if it's possible, or talk a bit more with some compromises I may make to do it!
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Details for Commissions</h3>
            <i>(Last updated 28th March, 2021)</i>
            <h4>General Details</h4>
            <p>
Payment will be made Up front and Content produced within 1-7 days of finalising all details for the Commission.
Things like my Face will not be included within a Videos unless something like a Hood is worn, I simply just don't like my face being in Videos especially considering the personal use of the videos.
Photos are an open door regarding what you want, but I will not do anything overly sexual and showing off anything of my goodies (with the exception of Transparent Latex Clothing).
<b>I'm not a P***Star and do not wish to be one.</b>

A Low quality video will be provided initially for reviewing of the video is up to standards and can changes can be made and a second revision can be done. If you are satisfied with the video you will be provided the full Quality version and the Commission is done.
Pictures will be provided in a Lower quality, and heavily watermarked, where changes can be made and a second revision can be done. If you are satisfied with the Photos, you will be provided the full Quality with a non obstructive Watermark
            </p>

            <h4>Questions</h4>
            <h5>Outfit?</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">
What Outfit do you want me to wear? I highly recommended having an idea for what you want in the first place, and checking out the photos/videos I've already produced on my profile already ( I own a lot ).
            </p>

            <h5>What I do? / Script</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">
For Photos: are there particular poses you want me to do?, Holding anything?, etc.
or For Videos: is there a specific action you want me to do? Make a bit of a "run down" for what I should do.
            </p>

            <h5>Location?</h5>
            <p>
Bed? My Common White Wall? Chair? Floor (Covered in Blanket or something)?
Etc. Please note this is a little limited due to being private, and rarely get an opportunity to do something more.
            </p>


            <h4>Video</h4>
            <p>
The Video will have A small Transparent watermark in the Corner to mark that this was produced by me.
Video will be 1080p at 30fps (60FPS for 25% extra for final payment) and rendered to 10,000 KBPS (so better than your average YouTube, Twitch or Netflix Quality)
            </p>

            <h4>Photos</h4>
            <p>
The Photos will be provided in a 2160 x 1728 resolution (depending on the crop, which ever one of these is the larger will be used for width/height). A Watermark in one of the corners will be used to mark this as my own

            <h4>Usage</h4>
            <p>
Video is intended for you to use and show others AND not to be placed onto Sites (such as YouTube, PornHub and more).
As the creator, I still have full rights to do whatever with the video. But cannot Share via a Paid/Subscription service or publicly for at least 6 months after the video is produced.
