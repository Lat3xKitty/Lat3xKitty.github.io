            <h2>Commissions</h2>
            <h3>Current Situation (Mostly Closed)</h3>
            <i>(Last updated 29th June 2021)</i>
            <p>
I am open to doing Commissions to people who are willing to buy an Item which will go towards the Commission. This will need to be discussed with me first regarding what Item you'd be happy to do and If I will accept it.
Additionally this is one means to try and allow for Commissions for people who aren't likely to be as much of time wasters for me to at least start off something.
                <br>
I plan to open up to doing some Commissions for people soon although I want to Stream line my processing for what I need to know for the Commission and provide some Basic Grounds rules (although I can change them on a Base by Base situation for a video).
Only one commission will be taken at a time to complete and that is all. I still have a full time job to do as well and do not wish to overflow myself with work.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Details for Commissions</h3>
            <i>(Last updated 28th March, 2021)</i>
            <h4>General Details</h4>
            <p>
Payment will be made Up front and Content produced within 1-4 days of finalising all details for the Commission.
Things like my Face will not be included within a Pictures/Videos unless something like a Hood is worn. Censored Photos of Face maybe arranged although this will be decided on a Base by base situation. THIS IS NOT NEGOTIABLE.
I will not do anything overly sexual and showing off anything of my goodies (with the exception of Transparent Latex Clothing)

A Low quality video will be provided initially for reviewing of the video is up to standards and can changes can be made and a second revision can be done. If you are satisfied with the video you will be provided the full Quality version and the Commission is done.
            </p>

            <h4>Questions</h4>
            <h5>Outfit?</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">
What Outfit do you want me to wear? I highly recommended having an idea for what you want in the first place, and checking out the existing content I have made for some ideas of what to do.
            </p>

            <h5>What I do? / Script</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">
For Photos: are there particular poses you want me to do?,
or For Videos: is there a specific action you want me to do?
            </p>

            <h5>Location?</h5>
            <p>
Bed? My Common White Wall? Chair? Floor (Covered in Blanket or something)?
Etc. Please note this is a little limited due to being private.
            </p>


            <h4>Video</h4>
            <p>
The Video will have A small Transparent watermark in the Corner to mark that this was produced by me.
Video will be 1080p at 30fps (60FPS for 25% extra for final payment) and rendered to 10,000 KBPS (so better than your average YouTube, Twitch or Netflix Quality)
            </p>

            <h4>Usage</h4>
            <p>
Video is intended for you to use and show others AND not to be placed onto Sites (such as YouTube, PornHub and more).
As the creator, I still have full rights to do whatever with the video. But cannot Share via a Paid/Subscription service or publicly for at least 6 months after the video is produced.
